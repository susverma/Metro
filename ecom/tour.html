                <span class="place">Bara Imambara</span>
                <p class="place-info"> This large structure was built by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula in 1786-91 and is one of
                    the architectural wonders of that era.
                    Its central hall is said to be the largest vaulted chamber in the world. Except for the galleries in
                    the interior, there is no woodwork in the entire structure. It is now used by Shia Muslims for the
                    purpose of Azadari. It is believed that the construction of this grand building was started in 1785
                    when a devastating famine had hit Awadh, and the nawab's objective was to provide employment for
                    people in the region for almost a decade while the famine lasted.
